# express-openapi-parser
This package parses a express project, generating a list of all routes, converted to the syntax used in a express route. It also provides a middleware wrapper that allows you to attach meta-data to whatever route you would like. This meta-data will be included in returned results of the parser. This can be used to attach documentation or other relevant data.
